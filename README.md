# DuaNL

Side project I am working on using React Native. Extremely basic React Native app where users can read Dua's in Arabic & Dutch.

# Goals

At the moment there are the following goals:

- Add more categories 
- Add a Favourites system (adding & removing Dua's)
- Add more Dua's

# Why are the Dua's hardcoded and not use sqllite or graphql?
 - api has to be hosted somewhere paid, something which I can't do, so for now they are hardcoded. Maybe in the future I'll swap to GraphQL.
